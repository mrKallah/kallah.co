					<h1>Week 3</h1>
					<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
						After a few days of trying to install both python3.5 and python 2.7 with TensorFlow’s NVIDIA Cuda tools having been stuck with trying to get the NVIDIA-Cuda-tools installed in a way that is compatible with TensorFlow. I have found that Cuda on Ubuntu does not work as you might expect. If you have more than one GPU you can get into some serious problems getting the Cuda tools to work. As long as you have two GPUs from different brands, say a NVIDIA graphics driver, coupled with an integrated graphics card in the CPU from Intel, the Cuda will not work on your system. The Cuda is apparently unable to cope with any ubuntu based system that has such a setup even if you manually disable either the standalone or the integrated GPU. I have not looked into this on pc, but I am currently using Ubuntu, so I have decided to go for the CPU limited way, at least for now. It’s a huge relief to finally start working and not having to work on the hell that is trying to figure out why things aren’t working by some cryptic error message.
						<br><br>I have also started to note down things needed to be in the installer as I go, and I am still not 100% sure if I will end up using python 3 or python 2.7 but as of now I am thinking that unless I find any good reason not to use python 3 I will continue to use it.
						<br><br>I have also started to do some work on implementing some stuff into code and I have been writing a classifier for the MNIST dataset to learn a bit more about how to do the actual implementation of the work into code. This has been an ok process where I have followed tutorials and I have learned a lot from this. One problem I keep jumping into is redundant processes where someone has done something a year or two ago and when I implement their code it gives me error where it’s been made redundant but it has no pointers to what it has been replaced by so I have had to restart a few times, and that makes me a bit weary to how TensorFlow updates and makes your code redundant.
						<br><br>I have also written two smaller scripts, one to resize a batch of images from one size to another and one that takes an image as input and prints it as an array. My aim with them, is to use those to resize the images in the datasets to a uniform size and then process them and then create a file that contains all the images as an array of images, but I haven’t gotten around to the point of making the script write the files yet as I haven’t decided on a file format. 
						<br><br>Anyways here’s a gif of the program running on windows, just because I had one:<br>

					<h1>Week 2</h1>
					<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
						This week I have mostly looked at the TensorFlow library and numpy, matplotlib and pylab to get a better understanding of the libraries I will be using over the next few weeks. I have started working on a schedule of what I want to get done per week and I want to be able to follow a structured plan, so I have a goal for each week that I should be able to do. In my first post I set 7 steps of what I wanted to do, and I will aim to get to step 5 and then if I manage to work past my own schedule I will start working on 6 and 7 when I can. In the meeting today, I said I had contacted Bob Rosses copyright holders and asked for permission to use his painting in my work, you mentioned to contact the copyright holders for Hockney to see if they wanted to give me permissions to use his paintings too. Last week you also gave me the set of pictures for the same artist the student before me used to do his project. 
						<br><br>This week I have also worked a bit on getting the blog up and going as that has been giving me a bit of grief. However, the account on my site has finally been fixed and I can now start posting here, rather than using a word document locally on my pc.

					<h1>Week 1</h1>
					<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
						What I plan to do for my project? 
						<br>For my project I aim to make a program that can take an input image of a painting and use a CNN to determine weather or not it was made by a specific artist. I aim to use multiple artists and have a “Bob Ross classifier” and a “Picasso classifier” etc. At the later stages of the project, if time allows I then wish to be able to add two more functionalities: One is Neural Style Transfer so I can put an image of anything into the Bob Ross (or any of the others) classifier and then get a Bob Ross painting out of it that still is an image of the hand but in the style of Bob Ross. The second functionality I then wish to add is to make the CNN then be able to take one image as a input from one artist and then detect if a second image is by that same artist using a Boolean classifier. I aim for the project to have some dependencies, mainly TensorFlow, which means I will write it in Python and so I have to spend some time brushing up on python these first weeks, to learn everything Python and TensorFlow related. For the project I hope to be able to have an installer which installs the appropriate packages and an interface to run it without using command line. For my priorities I have
						<br><br>1. Create the classifiers. 
						<br>2. Create the installer. 
						<br>3. Create the interface. 
						<br>4. Add the neural style transfer functionality. 
						<br>5. Add the neural style transfer to the interface. 
						<br>6. Add the any painting detector functionality. 
						<br>7. Add the any painting to the interface. 
						<br>I don’t think I will be able to complete all these tasks but I want to aim as high as possible, so I can continue to work, even when I finish one part so I don’t get stuck the last weeks of the project trying to polish the classifiers to get 3-4% better classification out of them. 
						<br><br>This was written in the first week and edited later to give it more sense.
