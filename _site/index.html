    <h1>Sous Vide</h1>
      <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
        <div class="paragraph">

          First off, I think I need to explain exactly what Sous Vide is. Sous Vide is French and means “Under Vacuum” and it is a method for cooking food with extreme precision. Let’s say you want to make the perfect steak that is medium rare all the way through. You fire up your frying pan or in max temperature and blast if for 2-3 minutes and the middle is good, however, there is about 0.5 cm on each side of well done steak, where the steak touched the pan. So, to battle this you put a larger steak in the oven, on a lower temperature for a longer time, this too will leave a crust of well done with a middle of juiciness.
          <br /><br />
          That’s where Sous Vide comes in. Sous vide is all about controlled temperature slow cooking. You seal your food, for this example a steak, in a plastic bag with herbs and spices, but you make sure there are no air in the bag. You then put the steak in a water bath that is precisely 54.4ºC and you cook it for two hours. After the two hours you then take the steak out and sear it for 30s on each side, leaving you with a perfectly medium rare steak with maybe a mm of crust.
          <br /><br />
          So, lately I’ve been working on making a Sous Vide machine, as I am a student and I don’t want to spend £100-200 on stuff to make food with, when I can try to make it for less than £10. So, I bought a temperature sensor, a relay, an Arduino and pulled out one of my old soldering irons, that still works but I have replaced with a new and better version. I then added all these together in the following setup:
          <br /><br />
          <img src="img/projects/sous_vide/sous_vide.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
          <br /><br />
          All of the components are marked with the part names, however, make sure to read the diagrams for your individual parts as certain misconfigurations can lead to broken components and even breaking the Arduino. When you wire everything up, I would advice to handle it with care, as the heating element is running on 230V AC, and therefor can be lethal. Don’t try to tackle this as your first project, if you don’t have any prior experience with higher voltages and be careful! The code for this project is available in the code section

    <h1>Digital Analysis of Paintings using TensorFlow</h1>
      <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
        <div class="paragraph">

          In this project, I investigated the ability to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the artist that made certain paintings. For this I needed to gather a dataset of paintings from different artists, and so I contacted the Van Gogh Museum and the Munch Museum, which gave me permission to use a large portion of their images. I also got access to a dataset from my Tutor, Dr. Hannah Dee, from Kyffin Williams. With this data, I could then train the network on what paintings from different artists looked like. When the network was trained, I could then save the model, and in a different program load that model. With this new software, I could then classify images, without re-training the network.
          <br /><br />
          Using the same model from the trained network I aimed to use Neural Style Transfer (NST) to extract style and content from two images and apply the content and style to a blank image, to make a new image that has the content of one image and the style of the other. This has been successful in making rather interesting looking images in other projects, however most projects use the models that have been trained on photos of things such as animals and plants. More information about this project can be found in the Archive. I made a blog while making the project, which is still available, however has been moved.
          <br /><br />
          In the diagram below, the process of the network is explained. It starts off by feeding the input image to the training network. The first step is to put the image though the convolutional layers, starting with layer one. The first layer applies its weights to the image and outputs the weighted images. These images are then fed into the second convolutional layer where their weights are also applied. It then outputs the processed images into the fully connected hidden layers. These layers have two outputs at the end which corresponds to the likelihood of the output being of a specific class. In this figure it is 70% certain that the image is by Gogh and 30% certain that the image is not by Gogh. It then picks the highest class and the image is then classified and the cycle repeats with a new image.
          <br /><br />
          <img src="img/projects/tensorflow/tf_weigts_2_layers.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
          <br /><br />
          The working version of the code is available on the code section, and a link to GitHub will be available when I get around to making my project files a bit easier to read, as they are a mess now. All the pictures uploaded to the classifier will be available to everyone and deleted when a new image is uploaded. This means that if you upload an image of yourself, anyone can see that image until the next time the webpage is used. I do not control what images people upload to the classifier, so use at your own risk.

                                My name is Lasse Falch Sortland, but a lot of people know me as Kallah. I am a <a style="text-decoration: initial;" id="dob"></a>-year-old computer scientist. I am born and raised in Norway, but I have done my Bachelor of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Aberystwyth University. This webpage is a place for me to talk about my projects, both university related projects and other projects that I do.
                                <br / ><br />
                                Under the code section, I have links to code I have written, some of which is open source and free for anyone to use. See in the description of each individual project for more information. There should also be a link under the code section to my GitHub page, which should have the most recent builds. I primarily work with C, C++, Java, Python and a few web-related languages.
                                <br / ><br />
                                I am interested in electronics, gaming, programming, cooking and photography. My projects will most likely revolve around these themes. Some of the ideas that I have, which I am considering working on, is a Sous Vide machine, weather station with a Neural Network based forecaster, a camera to classify paintings, a minesweeper solver and automated driving for one of the driving simulation games.

                                I mentioned that I like electronics, and for that reason, a lot of my projects will include Arduinos and components. I will try to include lists of parts and schematics, however if anything is missing, or you notice anything wrong, please feel free to send me an email in the contact me section.
